# Festivals of India

## Overview
This project showcases the diverse festivals celebrated in India, including Ramadan, Diwali, Christmas, and Independence Day. The application aims to educate users about these festivals through graphical representations using C with OpenGL.

## Festivals Included
- **Ramadan**: The ninth month of the Islamic calendar, observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting, prayer, and reflection.
- **Diwali**: A significant festival for Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists, symbolizing the victory of light over darkness and good over evil.
- **Christmas**: Celebrated by Christians to commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ.
- **Independence Day**: A day of national pride, marking India's independence from British rule.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Graphics Library**: OpenGL
- **Development Environment**: Code::Blocks

## OpenGL Functions Used
This project utilizes various OpenGL functions for graphical rendering:
- `glBegin()`: Defines the start of a primitive shape.
- `glEnd()`: Marks the end of the shape definition.
- `glPushMatrix()`: Saves the current matrix state.
- `glPopMatrix()`: Restores the last saved matrix state.
- `glTranslate()`: Moves objects in the 3D space.
- `glClearColor()`: Sets the clear color for the window.
- `glMatrixMode()`: Specifies which matrix stack is to be manipulated.
